# FARMAX: Excursions on Density - A Book Review
 
FARMAX: Excursions on Density is a book edited by Winy Maas, Jacob van Rijs and Richard Koek, and produced by MVRDV, a Dutch architecture firm. The book explores the phenomenon of low-density urbanization in the Netherlands and beyond, and proposes alternative scenarios for high-density living. The book consists of studies and designs made by MVRDV and students from various institutions, as well as contributions by other authors. The book was first published in 1998 and revised in 2006.

The book is divided into four parts: Dutch Tendencies, FARMAX, Excursions on Density, and Beyond FARMAX. The first part provides an overview of the current situation of urban sprawl in the Netherlands, and its social, economic and environmental implications. The second part introduces the concept of FARMAX, which stands for Floor Area Ratio Maximum. FARMAX is a method of measuring the density of a building or an area, based on the ratio of its floor area to its plot area. The book argues that FARMAX can be used as a tool for designing high-density environments that are diverse, efficient and livable. The third part presents a series of case studies that apply FARMAX to different contexts and scales, such as camping sites, villages, cities, regions and continents. The fourth part explores the future possibilities of FARMAX in relation to new technologies, lifestyles and challenges.
 
The book is richly illustrated with diagrams, drawings, photographs and models that demonstrate the potential of FARMAX as a design strategy. The book also includes a CD-ROM that contains a software program that allows users to calculate FARMAX values and visualize different scenarios. The book is intended for architects, urban planners, students and anyone interested in the topic of density and urbanism.
 
FARMAX: Excursions on Density is a provocative and inspiring book that challenges the conventional wisdom of low-density development. It offers a vision of high-density living that is not only feasible but also desirable. It is a book that invites readers to rethink the role of density in shaping our cities and our lives.
  
One of the main themes of the book is the contrast between claustrophobia and agoraphobia, or the fear of being enclosed and the fear of being exposed. The book argues that these two fears are often at the root of people's preferences and prejudices regarding density. The book challenges the common assumption that low-density living is more comfortable and desirable than high-density living, and shows that high-density environments can offer more variety, choice and freedom than low-density ones. The book also questions the notion of density as a fixed and objective measure, and shows that density can be perceived and experienced differently depending on the context and the design.
 
Another theme of the book is the relation between density and sustainability. The book claims that high-density living can be more efficient and ecological than low-density living, as it can reduce land consumption, energy use, infrastructure costs and transportation emissions. The book also suggests that high-density living can foster social cohesion and diversity, as it can create more opportunities for interaction and exchange among different groups of people. The book advocates for a balance between density and nature, and proposes ways of integrating green spaces and natural elements into high-density environments.
 
The book is not only a theoretical exploration of density, but also a practical demonstration of its possibilities. The book showcases a range of projects that illustrate how FARMAX can be applied to different situations and challenges. Some of the projects are hypothetical proposals, such as a vertical village in Lelystad, a horizontal skyscraper in Hong Kong, or a continental city in Europe. Some of the projects are actual commissions, such as a mixed-use complex in Amsterdam, a residential tower in Rotterdam, or a cultural center in Groningen. All of the projects share a common vision of creating high-density environments that are innovative, adaptable and livable.
